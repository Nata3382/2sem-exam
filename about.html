            <h2>Hi, I’m Arthur</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Arthur Monsacré, I am a 26y-o furniture maker
              originally from Paris, France. I created Monsi in June 2018. I
              first came to Copenhagen after my education in Paris in 2015, and
              had the chance to meet two fabulous woodworkers (Anders Guld &
              Kasper Løvenholdt) who took me under their wings for a couple of
              months. They could introduce me to Danish design and another
              approach regarding furniture making. After that, I went to Asia
              for about a year to perform my skills in different countries with
              woodworkers coming from a different background and use of machines
              than I could experience in Europe. I then went to the west part of
              France (Pays de la Loire), where I was making custom made
              terrasses in different shapes and heights. I could then have the
              opportunity to come back to Copenhagen and join the ‘Amager
              Snedkerhus’ collective in order to open my own company.

            Custom made projects, indoor/outdoor furniture, arrangement of
            spaces and adapting to the lifestyle of my customers from designing
            solutions to fabrication/mounting are my main occupations. I have
            also been working with some artists and designers in order to bring
            to life wood-related ideas and art projects.

              <p>
                The wood used for my projects is labelled FSC. This label
                ensures that the wood comes from forests that are managed
                responsibly. The wood is also a reusable resource and its
                recycling process needs less energy in comparison to other
                materials such as steel or aluminium. The wood that is used is
                mostly German oak or Scandinavian pine, in order to limit the
                travel impact and be as eco-friendly as possible.
